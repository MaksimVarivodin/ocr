Machine learning in translation — a new perspective

Machine learning (ML) enables digital computer systems to automatically learn
from a set of training data and make decisions based on the resulting model with a
minimum level of human intervention. From a methodology perspective, machine
learning is a form of statistical learning that uses computational algorithms to find
patterns in empirical data, rather than symbolic rules developed through the analy-
sis and intuitive reflection of humans. Neural machine translation (NMT) is driven
by machine learning, which is applied to a neural network language model' so as
to predict what word comes next in a sequence of translated text. There are many
more language tasks where ML can be leveraged in a translation process,
In theory and practice, machine learning and translation do not have to be seen
as separate undertakings. After all, there are clear links between human approaches
to translation and a machine’s processing of data, which also result in representa-
tions of thought and reality. While human approaches to translation follow long-
established methods of theorization, machine approaches, originating by the way
in the minds of computer scientists and software developers, utilize computer pro-
grams to automate part of the translation process.
Take an encoder-decoder ML architecture for example. In this model, machine
learning converts a real-life translation task into a mathematical formula (encod-
ing), and then after a series of arithmetic operations, it converts the mathematical
formula into a translation solution (decoding). In this sense, ML can be considered
at least a methodological and theoretical translation framework, although it may
be premature to call it a paradigm equivalent to other translation theories such as
equivalence, functionalism, descriptive translation studies (DTS), cultural or socio-
logical ‘turns’ of translation studies, localization, or audiovisual translation theories,
to name but several based primarily upon human analysis and reflection
